goals:
in the end: predict the quality surface with ML
machine learning model can be very promising (but we have to see if it will be successful)


thoughts:
ml approach (clean the data / noise):
- because we have to predict the quality surface, we should be careful if we overfit the model because we "only use Berlin"
- same road / same path ==> different rides can have different outcomes !
- weekend more rides than in weekdays
- need the lockdown data for berlin


general difficulties:

with the rides:
- numbers fluctuade --> small loyal userbase
- corona (less rides)
- people forget to turn on the app


with openstreetmap:
- we dont know, how recent the tags are (osm surface)
- gps not 100% accurate (street or sidewalk (not legal))
- difficult to rely on tags only


with gps:
- quality between ios and android
- phone of the bottom of the backpack
- battery low (energy saving mode - worse gps accuracy)
- gps problem with weather condition
