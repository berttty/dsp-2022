goals:
in the end: predict the quality surface with ML
machine learning model can be very promising (but we have to see if it will be successful)

important:
compare approaches in the end
- explain why we used specific steps


need:
reference for the area --> record a ride yourself (smooth or not?) (smooth / rough and "middle")
+5 example rides and compare it to simra rides
(Ernst Reuter - Brandenburger Tor - Alexanderplatz)
then extrapolate sections according to it
(dont upload the rides) - (ios:  (android: in settings - bottom export - simra.zip)


thoughts:

general:
- incident data not important

ml approach (clean the data / noise):
- because we have to predict the quality surface, we should be careful if we overfit the model because we "only use Berlin"
- same road / same path ==> different rides can have different outcomes !
- weekend more rides than in weekdays
- need the lockdown data for berlin
- k nearest neighbor


general difficulties:

with the rides:
- numbers fluctuade --> small loyal userbase
- corona (less rides)
- people forget to turn on the app
- we dont know (because GPS inaccuracy) if ride was on road or sidewalk
- labels are not accurate
- left turn behaviour of rides


with openstreetmap:
- we dont know, how recent the tags are (osm surface)
- gps not 100% accurate (street or sidewalk (not legal))
- difficult to rely on tags only


with gps:
- quality between ios and android
- phone of the bottom of the backpack
- battery low (energy saving mode - worse gps accuracy)
- gps problem with weather condition
